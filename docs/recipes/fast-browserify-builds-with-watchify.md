# Fast browserify builds with watchify

As a [browserify](http://github.com/substack/node-browserify) project begins to expand, the time to bundle it slowly gets longer and longer. While it might start at 1 second, it's possible to be waiting 30 seconds for your project to build on particularly large projects.

That's why [substack](http://github.com/substack) wrote [watchify](http://github.com/substack/watchify), a persistent browserify bundler that watches files for changes and *only rebuilds what it needs to*. This way, that first build might still take 30 seconds, but subsequent builds can still run in under 100ms â€“ which is a huge improvement.

Watchify doesn't have a gulp plugin, but it doesn't need one either: you can use [vinyl-source-stream](http://github.com/hughsk/vinyl-source-stream) to pipe the bundle stream into your gulp pipeline.

``` javascript
var gulp = require('gulp');
var gutil = require('gulp-util');
var source = require('vinyl-source-stream');
var watchify = require('watchify');
var browserify = require('browserify');

gulp.task('watch', function() {
  var bundler = watchify(browserify('src/index.js', watchify.args));

  // Optionally, you can apply transforms
  // and other configuration options on the
  // bundler just as you would with browserify
  bundler.transform('brfs');

  bundler.on('update', rebundle);

  function rebundle() {
    return bundler.bundle()
      // log errors if they happen
      .on('error', gutil.log.bind(gutil, 'Browserify Error'))
      .pipe(source('bundle.js'))
      .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist'));
  }

  return rebundle();
});
```
