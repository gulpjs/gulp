# symlink()

Creates a stream for linking [Vinyl][vinyl-concepts] objects to the file system.

## Usage
'
```js
const { src, symlink } = require('gulp');

function link() {
  return src('input/*.js')
    .pipe(symlink('output/'));
}

exports.link = link;
```

## Signature

```js
symlink(directory, [options])
```

### Parameters

| parameter | type | note |
|:--------------:|:-----:|--------|
| directory <br> **(required)** | string <br> function | The path of the output directory where symbolic links will be created. If a function is used, the function will be called with each Vinyl object and must return a string directory path. |
| options | object | Detailed in [Options][options-section] below. |

### Returns

A stream that can be used in the middle or at the end of a pipeline to create symbolic links on the file system.
Whenever a Vinyl object is passed through the stream, it creates a symbolic link to the original file on the file system at the given directory.

Whenever a symbolic link is created on the file system, the Vinyl object will be modified.
* The `cwd`, `base`, and `path` properties will be updated to match the created symbolic link.
* The `stat` property will be updated to match the symbolic link on the file system.
* The `contents` property will be set to `null`.
* The `symlink` property will be added or replaced with original path.

**Note:** On Windows, directory links are created using junctions by default. The `useJunctions` option disables this behavior.


### Errors

When `directory` is an empty string, throws an error with the message, "Invalid symlink() folder argument. Please specify a non-empty string or a function."

When `directory` is not a string or function, throws an error with the message, "Invalid symlink() folder argument. Please specify a non-empty string or a function."

When `directory` is a function that returns an empty string or `undefined`, emits an error with the message, "Invalid output folder".

### Options

**For options that accept a function, the passed function will be called with each Vinyl object and must return a value of another listed type.**

| name | type | default | note |
|:-------:|:------:|-----------|-------|
| cwd | string <br> function | `process.cwd()` |The directory that will be combined with any relative path to form an absolute path. Is ignored for absolute paths. Use to avoid combining `directory` with `path.join()`. |
| dirMode | number <br> function | | The mode used when creating directories. If not set, the process' mode will be used. |
| overwrite | boolean <br> function | true | When true, overwrites existing files with the same path. |
| relativeSymlinks | boolean <br> function | false | When false, any symbolic links created will be absolute. <br> **Note**: Ignored if a junction is being created, as they must be absolute. |
| useJunctions | boolean <br> function | true | This option is only relevant on Windows and ignored elsewhere. When true, creates directory symbolic link as a junction. Detailed in [Symbolic links on Windows][symbolic-links-section] below. |

## Symbolic links on Windows

When creating symbolic links on Windows, a `type` argument is passed to Node's `fs.symlink()` method which specifies the type of target being linked. The link type is set to:
`'file'` when the target is a regular file
`'junction'` when the target is a directory
`'dir'` when the target is a directory and the user disables the `useJunctions` option


If you try to create a dangling (pointing to a non-existent target) link, the link type can't be determined automatically. In these cases, behavior will vary depending on whether the dangling link is being created via `symlink()` or via `dest()`.

For dangling links created via `symlink()`, the incoming Vinyl object represents the target, so its stats will determine the desired link type. If `isDirectory()` returns false then a `'file'` link is created, otherwise a `'junction'` or a `'dir'` link is created depending on the value of the `useJunctions` option.

For dangling links created via `dest()`, the incoming Vinyl object represents the link - typically loaded from disk via `src(..., { resolveSymlinks: false })`. In this case, the link type can't be reasonably determined and defaults to using `'file'`. This may cause unexpected behavior when creating a dangling link to a directory. **Avoid this scenario.**
