# gulp changelog

## [5.0.0](https://www.github.com/gulpjs/gulp/compare/v4.0.2...v5.0.0) (2024-03-29)

We've tried to provide a high-level changelog for gulp v5 below, but it
doesn't contain all changes from the 60+ dependencies that we maintain.

Please see [individual changelogs](#individual-changelogs) to drill down
into all changes that were made.

### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* Drop support for Node.js <10.13
* Default stream encoding to UTF-8
* Standardized on `anymatch` library for globbing paths. All globs should work the same between `src` and `watch` now!
* Removed support for ordered globs. This aligns with the chokidar globbing implementation. If you need your globs to be ordered, you can use `ordered-read-stream`
* All globs and paths are normalized to unix-like filepaths
* Only allow JS variants for `.gulp.*` config files
* Removed support for alpha releases of v4 from `gulp-cli`
* Removed the `--verify` flag
* Renamed the `--require` flag to `--preload` to avoid conflicting with Node.js flags
* Removed many legacy and deprecated loaders
* Upgrade to chokidar v3
* Clone `Vinyl` objects with stream contents using `teex`, but no longer wait for all streams to flow before cloned streams will receive data
* Stop using `process.umask()` to make directories, instead falling back to Node's default mode
* Throw on non-function, non-string option coercers
* Drop support of Node.js snake_case flags
* Use a Symbol for attaching the `gulplog` namespace to the store
* Use a Symbol for attaching the `gulplog` store to the global
* Use sha256 to hash the `v8flags` cache into a filename

### Features

* Streamlined the dependency tree
* Switch all streams implementation to Streamx
* Rewrote `glob-stream` to use a custom directory walk that relies on newer Node.js features and is more performant than old implementation
* Implement translation support for all CLI messages and all messages passing through gulplog
* Allow users to customize or remove the timestamp from their logs
* Upgraded gulplog to v2. Messages logged via v1 will also display a deprecated warning. Plugins should update to v2 as the community upgrades to gulp 5
* Added support for `gulpile.cjs` and `gulpfile.mjs`
* Add support for `swc`, `esbuild`, `sucrase`, and `mdx` loaders
* Provide an ESM export ([#2760](https://www.github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2760)) ([b00de68](https://www.github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/b00de681f5ef6ade283d544f62f770f6b27a9e52))
* Support sourcemap handling on streaming `Vinyl` contents
* Support `extends` syntax for `.gulp.*` config file
* Allow overriding `gulpfile` and `preloads` via `.gulp.*` config file

### Bug Fixes

* Resolve bugs related to symlinks on various platforms
* Resolved some reported ReDoS CVEs and improved performance in glob-parent
* Rework errors surfaced when encountering files or symlinks when trying to create directories
* Ensure watch allows japanese characters in globs ([72668c6](https://www.github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/72668c61e445c81fad23bc6ed24967a3238a648d))
* Ensure watch does not trigger on negated globs ([72668c6](https://www.github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/72668c61e445c81fad23bc6ed24967a3238a648d))
* Improve handling of BOM at the beginning of a stream
* Properly handle function coercer in array of option coercers
* Fork `to-absolute-glob` to:
  - Check negative patterns before trimming
  - Ensure glob-like characters are escaped in cwd & root options
  - Resolve `../` at the beginning of globs

### Miscellaneous Chores

* Remove lazystream dependency
* Updated various stream test suites to test against Node.js core `stream`, `readable-stream`, and `streamx`
* Normalize repository, dropping node <10.13 support ([#2758](https://www.github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2758)) ([72668c6](https://www.github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/72668c61e445c81fad23bc6ed24967a3238a648d))

## 4.0.0

### Task system changes

- replaced 3.x task system (orchestrator) with new task system (bach)
  - removed gulp.reset
  - removed 3 argument syntax for `gulp.task`
  - `gulp.task` should only be used when you will call the task with the CLI
  - added `gulp.series` and `gulp.parallel` methods for composing tasks. Everything must use these now.
  - added single argument syntax for `gulp.task` which allows a named function to be used as the name of the task and task function.
  - added `gulp.tree` method for retrieving the task tree. Pass `{ deep: true }` for an `archy` compatible node list.
  - added `gulp.registry` for setting custom registries.

### CLI changes

- split CLI out into a module if you want to save bandwidth/disk space. you can install the gulp CLI using either `npm install gulp -g` or `npm install gulp-cli -g`, where gulp-cli is the smaller one (no module code included)
- add `--tasks-json` flag to CLI to dump the whole tree out for other tools to consume
- added `--verify` flag to check the dependencies in package.json against the plugin blacklist.

### vinyl/vinyl-fs changes

- added `gulp.symlink` which functions exactly like `gulp.dest`, but symlinks instead.
- added `dirMode` param to `gulp.dest` and `gulp.symlink` which allows better control over the mode of the destination folder that is created.
- globs passed to `gulp.src` will be evaluated in order, which means this is possible `gulp.src(['*.js', '!b*.js', 'bad.js'])` (exclude every JS file that starts with a b except bad.js)
- performance for gulp.src has improved massively
  - `gulp.src(['**/*', '!b.js'])` will no longer eat CPU since negations happen during walking now
- added `since` option to `gulp.src` which lets you only match files that have been modified since a certain date (for incremental builds)
- fixed `gulp.src` not following symlinks
- added `overwrite` option to `gulp.dest` which allows you to enable or disable overwriting of existing files
