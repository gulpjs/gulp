## What is gulp?

- **Automation** - gulp is a toolkit that helps you automate painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow.
- **Platform-agnostic** - Integrations are built into all major IDEs and people are using gulp with PHP, .NET, Node.js, Java, and other platforms.
- **Strong Ecosystem** - Use npm modules to do anything you want + over 2000 curated plugins for streaming file transformations
- **Simple** - By providing only a minimal API surface, gulp is easy to learn and simple to use

## What's new in 4.0?!

* The task system was rewritten from the ground-up, allowing task composition using `series()` and `parallel()` methods
* The watcher was updated, now using chokidar (no more need for gulp-watch!), with feature parity to our task system
* First-class support was added for incremental builds using `lastRun()`
* A `symlink()` method was exposed to create symlinks instead of copying files
* Built-in support for sourcemaps was added - the gulp-sourcemaps plugin is no longer necessary!
* Task registration of exported functions - using node or ES exports - is now recommended
* Custom registries were designed, allowing for shared tasks or augmented functionality
* Stream implementations were improved, allowing for better conditional and phased builds

## Sample `gulpfile.js`

This file will give you a taste of what gulp does.

```js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var less = require('gulp-less');
var babel = require('gulp-babel');
var concat = require('gulp-concat');
var uglify = require('gulp-uglify');
var rename = require('gulp-rename');
var cleanCSS = require('gulp-clean-css');
var del = require('del');

var paths = {
  styles: {
    src: 'src/styles/**/*.less',
    dest: 'assets/styles/'
  },
  scripts: {
    src: 'src/scripts/**/*.js',
    dest: 'assets/scripts/'
  }
};

/* Not all tasks need to use streams, a gulpfile is just another node program
 * and you can use all packages available on npm, but it must return either a
 * Promise, a Stream or take a callback and call it
 */
function clean() {
  // You can use multiple globbing patterns as you would with `gulp.src`,
  // for example if you are using del 2.0 or above, return its promise
  return del([ 'assets' ]);
}

/*
 * Define our tasks using plain functions
 */
function styles() {
  return gulp.src(paths.styles.src)
    .pipe(less())
    .pipe(cleanCSS())
    // pass in options to the stream
    .pipe(rename({
      basename: 'main',
      suffix: '.min'
    }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.styles.dest));
}

function scripts() {
  return gulp.src(paths.scripts.src, { sourcemaps: true })
    .pipe(babel())
    .pipe(uglify())
    .pipe(concat('main.min.js'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.scripts.dest));
}

function watch() {
  gulp.watch(paths.scripts.src, scripts);
  gulp.watch(paths.styles.src, styles);
}

/*
 * Specify if tasks run in series or parallel using `gulp.series` and `gulp.parallel`
 */
var build = gulp.series(clean, gulp.parallel(styles, scripts));

/*
 * You can use CommonJS `exports` module notation to declare tasks
 */
exports.clean = clean;
exports.styles = styles;
exports.scripts = scripts;
exports.watch = watch;
exports.build = build;
/*
 * Define default task that can be called by just running `gulp` from cli
 */
exports.default = build;
```

## Use latest JavaScript version in your gulpfile

Node already supports a lot of __ES2015+__ features, but to avoid compatibility problems we suggest to install Babel and rename your `gulpfile.js` to `gulpfile.babel.js`.

```sh
npm install --save-dev @babel/register @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```

Then create a **.babelrc** file with the preset configuration.

```js
{
  "presets": [ "@babel/preset-env" ]
}
```

And here's the same sample from above written in **ES2015+**.

```js
import gulp from 'gulp';
import less from 'gulp-less';
import babel from 'gulp-babel';
import concat from 'gulp-concat';
import uglify from 'gulp-uglify';
import rename from 'gulp-rename';
import cleanCSS from 'gulp-clean-css';
import del from 'del';

const paths = {
  styles: {
    src: 'src/styles/**/*.less',
    dest: 'assets/styles/'
  },
  scripts: {
    src: 'src/scripts/**/*.js',
    dest: 'assets/scripts/'
  }
};

/*
 * For small tasks you can export arrow functions
 */
export const clean = () => del([ 'assets' ]);

/*
 * You can also declare named functions and export them as tasks
 */
export function styles() {
  return gulp.src(paths.styles.src)
    .pipe(less())
    .pipe(cleanCSS())
    // pass in options to the stream
    .pipe(rename({
      basename: 'main',
      suffix: '.min'
    }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.styles.dest));
}

export function scripts() {
  return gulp.src(paths.scripts.src, { sourcemaps: true })
    .pipe(babel())
    .pipe(uglify())
    .pipe(concat('main.min.js'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.scripts.dest));
}

 /*
  * You could even use `export as` to rename exported tasks
  */
function watchFiles() {
  gulp.watch(paths.scripts.src, scripts);
  gulp.watch(paths.styles.src, styles);
}
export { watchFiles as watch };

const build = gulp.series(clean, gulp.parallel(styles, scripts));
/*
 * Export a default task
 */
export default build;
```

## Incremental Builds

You can filter out unchanged files between runs of a task using
the `gulp.src` function's `since` option and `gulp.lastRun`:
```js
const paths = {
  ...
  images: {
    src: 'src/images/**/*.{jpg,jpeg,png}',
    dest: 'build/img/'
  }
}

function images() {
  return gulp.src(paths.images.src, {since: gulp.lastRun(images)})
    .pipe(imagemin({optimizationLevel: 5}))
    .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.images.dest));
}

function watch() {
  gulp.watch(paths.images.src, images);
}
```
Task run times are saved in memory and are lost when gulp exits. It will only
save time during the `watch` task when running the `images` task
for a second time.
